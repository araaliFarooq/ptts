                <h2>Tracking Benefits</h2>
                <p>The GPS or Global Positioning System has become a very advanced technology. The main idea behind using this
                    system is to find the location of the person, vehicle or an item. Most people think about vehicle tracking
                    GPS system as something that helps find a stolen vehicle.</p>
                <p>However, its uses have expanded into many other fields where the data obtained through this device is combined
                    with other processes to efficiently manage a business or an organization. It not only protects the driver and
                    passengers but also allows the vehicle owners to keep track of their vehicleâ€™s position. Some systems can
                    immediately alert the owner or monitoring department about any deviation from the fixed route.</p>
                <p>The next type of vehicle tracking GPS devices is capable of communicating the position data to a central server.
                    Generally, the tracking device is part of the integrated automobile electronic system. If the destination is
                    known then there is no way the driver will lose the route or arrive at a different location.</p>
                <p>The GPS technology relies on data received through satellites to calculate the exact position on earth. This
                    data can be viewed instantly by the driver. If the device has data sending capability then the data is sent to
                    the fleet management and monitoring center.</p>
                <p>Vehicle tracking GPS devices are being used in a wide range of industries. Companies use it to better organize
                    movement of vehicles and goods. It helps in efficient management of trucks, buses, cars, or any other type of
                    vehicles.</p>
                <p>It results in saving time and money because drivers do not waste time in finding destination. They stay on the
                    route and cannot bill incorrectly. Goods are delivered on time and various things like sales, delivery and
                    inventory can be coordinated more efficiently.</p>
                <p>There are various benefits of using vehicle tracking GPS system. These benefits include:</p>

                   <ul>
                       <li>Finding the position of a stolen vehicle
                       <li>Receiving alert message if the vehicle deviates from its route

                       <li>Efficient inventory management
                       <li>Driver can easily find the nearest emergency center or service station
